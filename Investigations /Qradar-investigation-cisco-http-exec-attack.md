## üß† Analyst Assessment
The observed request targeted a web path:  
`/level/15/exec/-/sh/run/CR`  

This path resembles a **remote code execution (RCE)** attempt ‚Äî specifically targeting devices or services that expose shell execution endpoints (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, network admin panels, or custom APIs).

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- Not typical of normal user traffic  
- Automated scanning/probing behavior is strongly suspected  
- **Potential intent:** gain unauthorized remote access or run shell commands

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Actions
- Audit and restrict access to `/exec/` or similar endpoints  
- Enforce strict authentication and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- Monitor logs for repeated shell execution patterns  
- Disable shell access via HTTP unless explicitly required and secured

---

## üìò Lessons Learned
- Automating threat validation using **QRadar + VirusTotal + Shodan** improves triage efficiency  
- Common user agents like **libwww-perl** are often seen in exploit scanning  
- Structured documentation accelerates collaboration during incident response
