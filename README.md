# Toluwanimi-Cybersecurity-Portfolio
Hi, I’m Toluwanimi — I’m an IT and Cybersecurity professional with experience in vulnerability management and SOC operations. I’ve worked with tools like Tenable, Splunk, and Cortex Xpanse to support enterprise security posture. I’m looking to connect with teams working on threat detection, cloud security, or automation.
